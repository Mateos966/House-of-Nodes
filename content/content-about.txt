# Who We Are

## House of Nodes or Node House

House of Nodes, also known as **Node House**, is a cooperative designed to support individuals, creatives, and groups who face financial difficulties and find themselves excluded from conventional financial systems.

### Our Mission

At **House of Nodes**, we believe in inclusion and in providing opportunities for those who, for various reasons, cannot access personal loans, business loans, or financing for their own homes and families.

We live in a society that often marginalizes those who do not fit the traditional financial stability parameters. These individuals may have faced failed investments, unfortunate circumstances, or simply do not meet standard credit criteria. As a result, they find themselves trapped in a cycle of expensive rentals, financial instability, and social exclusion.

However, **many of these individuals possess valuable skills, determination, and the ability to create jobs for themselves and others**. House of Nodes exists to provide an environment where they can develop their potential and rebuild their financial and social stability.

### What We Offer

At **House of Nodes**, we provide a supportive community that offers essential tools for the economic and professional reintegration of our members:

- **Financial Management:**
  - Invoicing and issuance of legal receipts.
  - Reporting and compliance with tax obligations.
- **Rent-to-own schemes**, based on the cooperative's creditworthiness.
- **Establishment of formal business relationships** between customers and suppliers within the House of Nodes network.

### Our Vision

We aim to be a **refuge and a platform for growth** for talented individuals who need an opportunity to showcase their value. At **House of Nodes**, we not only provide financial and structural support but also foster collaboration and the development of a community where each member can contribute and benefit.

**If you have skills, talent, and determination, but circumstances have placed you in a difficult situation, House of Nodes is your place to start anew.**
