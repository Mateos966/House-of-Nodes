            <h1>Welcome to House of Nodes</h1>
            <p>Your Place, Your Business, Your Future</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p>House of Nodes, also known as <strong>Node House</strong>, is a cooperative designed to support
                individuals,
                creatives, and groups who face financial difficulties and find themselves excluded from conventional
                financial systems.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At <strong>House of Nodes</strong>, we believe in inclusion and in providing opportunities for those who,
                for
                various reasons, cannot access personal loans, business loans, or financing for their own homes and
                families.</p>
            <p>We live in a society that often marginalizes those who do not fit the traditional financial stability
                parameters. These individuals may have faced failed investments, unfortunate circumstances, or simply do
                not
                meet standard credit criteria. As a result, they find themselves trapped in a cycle of expensive
                rentals,
                financial instability, and social exclusion.</p>
            <p><strong>However, many of these individuals possess valuable skills, determination, and the ability to
                    create
                    jobs for themselves and others.</strong> House of Nodes exists to provide an environment where they
                can
                develop their potential and rebuild their financial and social stability.</p>

            <h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Management:</strong> Invoicing, issuance of legal receipts, and tax compliance.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rent-to-own schemes:</strong> Based on the cooperative's creditworthiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Networking:</strong> Establishing formal relationships between customers and
                    suppliers
                    within the House of Nodes network.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We aim to be a <strong>refuge and a platform for growth</strong> for talented individuals who need an
                opportunity to showcase their value. At <strong>House of Nodes</strong>, we not only provide financial
                and
                structural support but also foster collaboration and the development of a community where each member
                can
                contribute and benefit.</p>
            <p><strong>If you have skills, talent, and determination, but circumstances have placed you in a difficult
                    situation, House of Nodes is your place to start anew.</strong></p>
